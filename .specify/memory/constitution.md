# SpeckIt Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Clean Code Foundation
Code MUST be written with clarity, maintainability, and simplicity as primary goals. Every function, class, and module should have a single, well-defined responsibility. Code MUST be self-documenting through meaningful names, clear structure, and minimal complexity. Refactoring MUST be performed continuously to improve code quality without changing external behavior.

Rationale: Clean code reduces technical debt, accelerates onboarding, and enables sustainable development velocity.

### II. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Tests MUST be written before implementation code following the Red-Green-Refactor cycle. All functionality MUST be covered by automated tests that verify both happy paths and edge cases. Test code MUST be treated as a first-class citizen with the same quality standards as production code.

Rationale: TDD ensures requirements are understood before implementation, provides safety net for refactoring, and serves as living documentation.

### III. User Experience First
All features MUST be designed with the end user's needs, mental models, and workflows as the primary focus. Interfaces MUST be intuitive, responsive, and accessible. User feedback MUST be actively sought and incorporated throughout the development process. Complexity MUST be hidden from users while providing power features for advanced users.

Rationale: Delightful user experience drives adoption, reduces support burden, and creates sustainable user satisfaction.

### IV. Continuous Integration & Delivery
All code changes MUST be automatically tested and validated before merging. deployments MUST be automated, repeatable, and reversible. The system MUST be designed for zero-downtime deployments with feature flags to control release timing.

Rationale: Continuous delivery enables rapid feedback, reduces integration risk, and allows quick response to user needs.

### V. Observability & Monitoring
All system components MUST emit structured logs for debugging and audit trails. Critical user journeys and system health MUST be monitored with appropriate alerts. Performance metrics MUST be tracked to identify regressions and optimization opportunities.

Rationale: Observability enables proactive issue detection, faster troubleshooting, and data-driven optimization decisions.

## Development Standards

### Code Quality Standards
- Code MUST adhere to established style guides with automated enforcement
- All pull requests MUST require at least one peer review before merging
- Code complexity MUST be measured and kept below defined thresholds
- Documentation MUST be updated alongside code changes

### Security Requirements
- All user data MUST be encrypted at rest and in transit
- Authentication and authorization MUST be properly implemented for all protected resources
- Security scanning MUST be performed regularly and vulnerabilities addressed promptly
- Privacy MUST be respected with minimal data collection and clear consent

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests MUST achieve minimum 80% code coverage
- Integration tests MUST verify critical user journeys
- Performance tests MUST validate response times under expected load
- Accessibility tests MUST ensure compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards

### Review Process
- All features MUST be tested in a staging environment before production deployment
- User acceptance testing MUST be performed for significant features
- Post-deployment monitoring MUST confirm expected behavior and performance
- Incident retrospectives MUST be conducted for all production issues

## Governance

This constitution serves as the foundation for all development practices and decisions. Amendments require documented proposal, team review, and consensus approval. All development practices MUST align with these principles, with documented justification for any exceptions.

The constitution version follows semantic versioning:
- MAJOR version for backward-incompatible changes to principles
- MINOR version for additions of new principles or sections
- PATCH version for clarifications and non-semantic refinements

Compliance with this constitution MUST be verified during code reviews and architecture discussions. Deviations require explicit documentation and team approval.
