# Implementation Plan: Expense Tracker Application

**Branch**: `001-expense-tracker` | **Date**: 2025-10-24 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-expense-tracker/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Build a responsive web application for expense tracking that allows users to record, categorize, filter, and visualize financial transactions. The application will feature a clean, intuitive interface with real-time data visualization and comprehensive filtering capabilities. The solution will be implemented as a single-page application using modern web technologies with local storage for data persistence.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.0+, HTML5, CSS3  
**Primary Dependencies**: React 18+, Chart.js, date-fns, Tailwind CSS  
**Storage**: IndexedDB (via Dexie.js) for client-side persistence  
**Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress for E2E  
**Target Platform**: Progressive Web App (PWA) - works on desktop and mobile browsers  
**Project Type**: Single web application  
**Performance Goals**: <200ms UI response time, handle 10,000+ expenses smoothly  
**Constraints**: Must work offline, responsive design for mobile-first approach  
**Scale/Scope**: Personal finance tool for individual users, 10,000+ expenses, 50+ categories  

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- Clean Code Foundation: Is the solution designed with clarity, maintainability, and simplicity? ✓
- Test-Driven Development: Are tests planned before implementation with adequate coverage? ✓
- User Experience First: Does the design prioritize user needs and intuitive workflows? ✓
- Continuous Integration: Can the solution be tested and deployed automatically? ✓
- Observability: Are logging, monitoring, and performance metrics planned? ✓

**Structure Decision**: Single web application with component-based architecture using React for optimal reusability and maintainability.

## Complexity Tracking

No constitution violations requiring justification.

## Data Model

### Core Entities

**Expense**:
- id: string (UUID)
- amount: number
- date: Date
- categoryId: string
- paymentMethod: PaymentMethod
- description: string
- notes: string (optional)
- createdAt: Date
- updatedAt: Date

**Category**:
- id: string (UUID)
- name: string
- color: string (hex color)
- budgetLimit: number (optional)
- createdAt: Date
- updatedAt: Date

**PaymentMethod**: Enum (CASH, CREDIT_CARD, DEBIT_CARD, BANK_TRANSFER, DIGITAL_WALLET, OTHER)

**Filter**:
- dateRange: { start: Date, end: Date }
- categoryIds: string[]
- amountRange: { min: number, max: number }
- paymentMethods: PaymentMethod[]
- searchText: string

## API Contracts

### Storage Service Interface

```typescript
interface IStorageService {
  // Expense operations
  getExpenses(filter?: Filter): Promise<Expense[]>
  getExpense(id: string): Promise<Expense | null>
  saveExpense(expense: Expense): Promise<Expense>
  deleteExpense(id: string): Promise<void>
  
  // Category operations
  getCategories(): Promise<Category[]>
  getCategory(id: string): Promise<Category | null>
  saveCategory(category: Category): Promise<Category>
  deleteCategory(id: string): Promise<void>
}
```

## Performance Considerations

- Implement virtual scrolling for large expense lists
- Use memoization for expensive calculations
- Implement efficient filtering with indexed queries
- Lazy load chart data based on visible date ranges
- Optimize bundle size with code splitting

## Security Considerations

- Validate all user input on both client and potential server side
- Sanitize data to prevent XSS attacks
- Implement proper error handling to prevent data leakage
- Consider data encryption for sensitive financial information
