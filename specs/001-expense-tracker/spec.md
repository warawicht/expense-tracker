### User Story 1 - Record Daily Expenses (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to quickly record my daily expenses with essential details so that I can maintain an accurate financial record.

3. **Given** I have entered multiple expenses, **When** I view the expense list, **Then** I see all my expenses ordered by date (newest first)
